# Arcade

This repository is my personal take on the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/how/).

Instead of creating 20 separate small projects, I decided to build them all inside a single **Arcade** project using the Godot Engine. Each minigame represents one step of the challenge, gradually introducing new mechanics and concepts while helping me practice different aspects of game development such as design, programming, art, sound, and project planning.

The goal is not to make polished commercial games, but to explore a wide variety of ideas, learn by doing, and mark clear milestones along the way.  

By the end of the challenge, this project should become a collection of diverse minigames that showcase my progress and growth as a game developer.
